1) Would you use a unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “message” feature allows a user to write and send a message to another user.
   - Yes. Unit tests are great for testing messaging features like writing, sending, receiving messages, ensuring they work well. These tests help to check users write and receive messages without errors and that the system handles issues smoothly. 

2) Would you use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature of a messaging application? Why or why not? For this question, assume the “max message length” feature prevents the user from typing more than 80 characters.
   - Yes. A unit test would be ideal for checking the "max message length" feature in a messaging app, ensuring users can't exceed 80 characters. This test confirms the app correctly restricts input and provides the right feedback.
